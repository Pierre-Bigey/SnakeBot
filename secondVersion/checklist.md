## 1. Game Implementation (Snake Game)

- ### Game Grid: A grid representation for the game world (e.g., 10x10).

- Use NumPy to create the grid for easy manipulation.
- Each cell could hold values representing empty space, the snake's body, or the food.

- ### Snake Movement:

- The snake should move in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right) based on the output of the neural network.
- Handle the snake's body updating logic, including adding to the head when the snake eats food, and removing the tail if no food is eaten.
- ### Collision Detection:

- Detect collisions with the walls and the snake's body to end the game.

- ### Game Reset:

- Once the snake dies, reset the game with a new grid, snake position, and food placement.
- This reset should be fast to allow many quick game simulations.

- ### Multiple Games:

- Run a set of N games (e.g., 30) for each snake to calculate fitness, ensuring each game is independent.

## 2. Neural Network (with PyTorch)

- ### Input Layer:

- Input size = 32 (24 from vision in 8 directions + 4 from the current direction + 4 from the tail direction).

- ### Hidden Layers:

- First hidden layer: 32 neurons with ReLU activation.
- Second hidden layer: 16 neurons with ReLU activation.

- ### Output Layer:

- 4 neurons representing the four movement directions (up, down, left, right) with a softmax activation to produce probabilities.

- ### Forward Pass:

- For each game state, pass the inputs through the network to get a move direction.


## 3. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

- ### Population of Networks:

- Define a population of neural networks with randomly initialized weights.

- ### Fitness Function:

- For each network, run multiple games (e.g., 30), collect statistics like survival time, and food collected, and compute an average score to measure the network's fitness.

- ### Mutation:

- Introduce random mutations in the weights of the networks at each generation (after computing fitness).
- Mutate only the top-performing networks (elitism) and create new generations from them.

- ### Selection:

- Select the best-performing networks based on fitness and use them as parents for the next generation.

- ### Crossover (optional):

- You could implement a simple crossover where two networks exchange parts of their weight matrices to create offspring.

## 4. Parallelization Strategy

- ### Per-Snake Parallelization:

- Run multiple games in parallel for one neural network to evaluate its fitness more quickly.
- Use multiprocessing in Python to manage running these games in parallel.

- ### Efficient Game Simulation:

- Each game should run quickly, especially with a 10x10 grid. Minimize overhead between frames to allow many simulations.

## 5. Fitness Measurement

- ### Metrics:
- Survival time (how long the snake survives).
- Food collected (key to incentivize the snake to find food rather than just survive).

- ### Multiple Trials:
- Measure the fitness of a snake by making it play multiple games (e.g., 30 games) and averaging the score.
